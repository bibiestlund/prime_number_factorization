# prime_number_factorization
The first 11 prime integers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. A positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive),
other than the first 11 prime integers, is prime if it is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. This is 
a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer between and (inclusive) and that outputs whether the number is 
prime. If the number is not prime, then outputs all the numbers, from the list of the first 11 prime integers, which divide the
number.
